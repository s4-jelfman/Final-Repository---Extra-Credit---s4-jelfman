It is always found associated with pfam00226 and pfam00684. DnaJ is a chaperone associated with the Hsp70 heat-shock system involved in protein folding and renaturation after stress. The two C-terminal domains CTDI and CTDII, both incorporated in this family are necessary for maintaining the J-domains in their specific relative positions. Structural analysis of Structure 1nlt shows that pfam00684 is nested within this DnaJ C-terminal region.

The central cysteine-rich (CR) domain of DnaJ proteins contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG where X is any amino acid. The isolated cysteine rich domain folds in zinc dependent fashion. Each set of two repeats binds one unit of zinc. Although this domain has been implicated in substrate binding, no evidence of specific interaction between the isolated DNAJ cysteine rich domain and various hydrophobic peptides has been found.

DnaJ domains (J-domains) are associated with hsp70 heat-shock system and it is thought that this domain mediates the interaction. DnaJ-domain is therefore part of a chaperone (protein folding) system. The T-antigens, although not in Prosite are confirmed as DnaJ containing domains from literature.

The central cysteine-rich (CR) domain of DnaJ proteins contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG where X is any amino acid. The isolated cysteine rich domain folds in zinc dependent fashion. Each set of two repeats binds one unit of zinc. Although this domain has been implicated in substrate binding, no evidence of specific interaction between the isolated DNAJ cysteine rich domain and various hydrophobic peptides has been found.

It is always found associated with pfam00226 and pfam00684. DnaJ is a chaperone associated with the Hsp70 heat-shock system involved in protein folding and renaturation after stress. The two C-terminal domains CTDI and CTDII, both incorporated in this family are necessary for maintaining the J-domains in their specific relative positions. Structural analysis of Structure 1nlt shows that pfam00684 is nested within this DnaJ C-terminal region.
